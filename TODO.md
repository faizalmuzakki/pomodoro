### 🧠 **To Fight Sleepiness and Stay Alert**

Here’s how to use your desk more effectively for energy:

#### ✅ Start Your Day Standing

* Start with **15–30 minutes of standing** when you're freshest (e.g., during email or light tasks).
* It helps your brain “wake up” and increases alertness.

#### ⏱ Alternate Often

* Switching every **30–60 minutes** keeps blood flowing and reduces the sluggish feeling from prolonged sitting.
* Set a timer or use a Pomodoro technique (e.g., 50 minutes work, 10 minutes switch/stand).

#### 🚶‍♂️ Take Active Breaks

* Every 90–120 minutes, take a **5–10 minute walk** (not just standing) to really refresh your brain.
